## Status

Still under development.

## Description

This application starts up a AWT/Swing applet and:

* records a user's interactions
* plays them back later
* tests the GUI state

For flexibility, the user can edit the recording.

## Use-cases

* Testing conformance with an SLA (service-level agreement), with detailed uptime statistics.
* Automated GUI testing during development.
