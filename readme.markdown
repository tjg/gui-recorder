# Swing Recorder

## Status

Experimental. This app is still in progress and not yet runnable.

## Description

This application records a user's interactions with an AWT/Swing applet, replays them, and determine whether the GUI has responded correctly and within a certain timeframe.

For flexibility, the user can edit her recorded interactions with (for instance) a text editor.

## Use-cases

* Testing conformance with an SLA (service-level agreement), with detailed uptime statistics.
* Automated testing during development. With much less tedium.
